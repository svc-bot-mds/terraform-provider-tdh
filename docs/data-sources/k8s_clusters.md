# tdh_k8s_clusters (Data Source)

Used to fetch all Kubernetes Clusters within an provider account.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# For onboarding the data plane use the k8s cluster with the attribute "available" is set to true
# If onboarding data Plane on TDH Control Plane, use the k8s cluster with the attribute "cp_present" is set to true and "dp_present" is set to false

data "tdh_k8s_clusters" "all" {
  account_id = "CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID" # can be fetched using 'tdh_cloud_accounts" datasource
}
output "resp" {
  value = data.tdh_k8s_clusters.all
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) ID of the provider account

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The testing framework requires an id attribute to be present in every data source and resource.
- `list` (Attributes List) List of Kubernetes Clusters. Can be used while creating resource `tdh_data_plane`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--list))

<a id="nestedatt--list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `list`

Read-Only:

- `available` (Boolean) Denotes if the Kubernetes Cluster is available for onboarding or not.
- `cp_present` (Boolean) Denotes if Control Plane is available. Use the Kubernetes Cluster with this set to `true` while onboarding Data Plane on TDH Control Plane.
- `dp_present` (Boolean) Denotes if Data Plane is already deployed. Use the Kubernetes Cluster with this set to `false` while onboarding Data Plane on TDH Control Plane.
- `name` (String) Name of the Kubernetes Cluster.
