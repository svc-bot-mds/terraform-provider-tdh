# tdh_regions (Data Source)

Used to fetch the regions having data-planes by desired amount of resources available.
## Note:
- At a time, either `instance_size` or all of (`cpu`, `memory`, `storage`, `node_count`) can be passed.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# pass valid data with respect to the instance type selected
data "tdh_regions" "dedicated_aws" {
  instance_size        = "XX-SMALL"
  dedicated_data_plane = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `provider_type` (String) Shortname of cloud provider platform where data-plane lives. Ex: `aws`, `gcp` .

### Optional

- `cpu` (String) K8s CPU units required. Ex: `500m`, `1` (1000m) .
- `dedicated_data_plane` (Boolean) If set to `true`, only data-planes that are exclusive to current Org (determined by API token used) are queried. Else only shared ones.
- `instance_size` (String) Type of instance size. Supported values: `XX-SMALL`, `X-SMALL`, `SMALL`, `LARGE`, `XX-LARGE`.
- `memory` (String) K8s memory units required. Ex: `800Mi`, `2Gi` .
- `node_count` (String) Count of worker nodes that must be present in a data-plane. Ex: `3` .
- `storage` (String) K8s storage units required. Ex: `2Gi` .

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The testing framework requires an id attribute to be present in every data source and resource.
- `regions` (Attributes List) Response of regional data-planes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--regions))

<a id="nestedatt--regions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `regions`

Read-Only:

- `data_plane_ids` (List of String) List of data-plane IDs that are created by SRE & registered on TDH.
- `id` (String) ID of the region.
- `name` (String) Name of the region.
